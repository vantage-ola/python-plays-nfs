I try to use neural networks to possibly learn how to drive in the need for speed 2012 game.
Thanks to sentdex https://github.com/Sentdex/ i was able to use similar method while coding.
But unfortunately i will continue when i get a better laptop/computer because tensorflow has been giving me some problems because of hardware requirements.

3. Run balance_data.py(optional)
4. Train your model with train_model.py
